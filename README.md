# PartyMixer
Collaboratively edited playlists for your parties.

## TODO

* ~~.env file~~
* browserify
* Add security middleware
* Stop playing animation when playback pauses (maybe use rubentd/gifplayer?)
* Make routes less fat

### Nice-to-have*s*

* Add ability to repeat already added songs once the end of the playlist is reached
* Suggest some songs to kick off the party after it's created
  * either whatever is popular at the moment or based on the host's past parties (and guest's past parties, as they join)
* Always-working suggest feature (collaborative filtering)
